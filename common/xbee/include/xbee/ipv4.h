   Dev notes:

   Consider this a starting point.  I think we could develop something
   based on the wpan/aps.h APIs for using "envelope" structures to
   route frames.  Implementing Berkeley sockets is going to take a bit
   of work (and buffering), but keeping tables for open and listening
   sockets with handlers to receive ipv4_envelope_t structures should
   work well for typical use cases.
