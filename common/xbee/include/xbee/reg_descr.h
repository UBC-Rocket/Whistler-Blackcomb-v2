       This field is a bitmask, which determines whether this entry is
       applicable to a given XBee module type.  A mask (M) for the module is
       obtained by (e.g.) M = sxa_module_type_mask(sxa).  Then, only if
       (M & cxval) == M is the entry applicable.

       One of the bits in cxval is for a "gateway" i.e. a local module.
       If this bit is NOT set in cxval, then such commands are not usually
       performed on local devices, usually because changing that register
       might disrupt the network and make it inaccessible.  In cases where
       it really is necessary to change one of these registers, the gateway
       bit in M can be reset before applying the above bitmask test.

       @note This mask behavior is derived from NDS and is used by iDigi.
