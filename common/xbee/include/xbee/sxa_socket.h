   /**
      @brief Network interface Maximum Transmission Unit, as seen by TCP stack.

      Selection of this constant is a bit tricky.  ZigBee has a small MTU,
      however the XBee modules accept larger payloads and fragments them
      if necessary when transmitting.  TCP likes to avoid fragmentation and
      tries to select an MSS (TCP payload size) as large as possible, but not
      so large as to require any fragmentation along the transmission path.

      There is no reliable method to set the MSS, because the ZigBee MTU
      depends on various header options such as encryption and source
      routing.  Because of this, we select a conservative value for the
      TCP MSS of 64 bytes.  To this, we add 40 bytes (for the IP and TCP
      headers) to get an MTU of 104, since TCP computes its MSS by assuming
      IP and TCP headers are required for each segment.  This MTU of 104
      exceeds that for ZigBee, however out implementation of SXA sockets
      effectively compresses the IP and TCP headers into a 6-byte header.
      This gives a real MTU of 64+6 = 70 bytes.  This is an acceptable
      envelope payload size, which will avoid fragmentation.

      Thus, whatever this constant is, the real MTU will be 34 bytes
      less than this, and the TCP MSS will be 40 bytes less.
