   On/Off Cluster: Attributes and commands for switching devices between
   'On' and 'Off' states.

   ZCL General Specification, Section 3.8

   On/Off Switch Configuration Cluster: Attributes and commands for
   configuring On/Off switching devices.

   ZCL General Specification, Section 3.9

   @todo Write code to support OnOff commands.  Create sample program
         demonstrating use of these clusters (perhaps using LEDs and
         switches of XBIB-U-DEV board).  REQUIRES: need to have reporting
         in place before this cluster is really useful.  Devices need to
         receive updates whenever switch status changes.
